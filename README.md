Add Leading Zeroes to Files

--Do you like files showing up the same way regardless of which way they are sorted? I do!

--Do you have a lot of files to rename? This little script will help you.

More or less takes all files that are currently named 100.whatever and turns them into 0100.whatever as an example. 

So: 1.png, 002.jpg, 0371.png 03.png 9999.gif 5.blah fu.bar

Turns into:

0001.png

0002.jpg

0371.png

0003.png

9999.gif

0005.blah

fu.bar
