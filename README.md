# Utilities
Various utilities to help make life on the Internet a little easier.

-------------------------------
**Add Leading Zeroes to Files**

**Usage:** 
--Drop this .py file into any directory with PNGs, JPGs, or GIFs and it will rename files accordingly with leading zeroes on the file name.

**Use Case:**
--Do you like files showing up the same way regardless of which way they are sorted? I do!
--Do you have a lot of files to rename? This little script will help you.

**I/O:** 
example input: 

1.png

002.jpg

0371.png

03.png

9999.gif

5.blah

fu.bar

example output:

0001.png

0002.jpg

0371.png

0003.png

9999.gif

0005.blah

fu.bar


-------------------------------------------
**Convert Backgrounds to Favorable Format**

**Usage:**

--Drop this .py file into any directory with PNGs, JPGs, or GIFs to convert to a PNG format (2560 x 1440) - This format is great for the Odyssey G7 monitor.

**I/O:** 

example input/output:

An image is below 2560 x 1440 in height or width. It is rescaled by height first. Any additional width is added to the image so that it will show centered as a new image titled me.resized.png as an example. 

Very useful for getting many images into one singular size for a particular program (or in my case - simply to resize desktop backgrounds).

**Use Case:**
--Do you like all of your various background files in the same format without needling to hassle yourself with various common formats and sizes? This script is for you. 


-------------------
**Get Backgrounds (Specific)**
--Scrapes 4chan.org/wg for wallpaper background files in a specific format (2560 x 1440)

Note: 4Chan is not really a regulated, moderated, or generally 'nice' place in my opinion. That being said: it can be a high quality wallpaper source if you are open to being subjected to a few (hopefully not terrible) images that come with the downloading of many other images. 

Simply put - be aware of what you could be possibly accessing and downloading. Don't say I didn't warn you.
